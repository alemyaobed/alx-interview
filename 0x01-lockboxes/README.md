# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Solution

To solve the problem of determining if all boxes can be opened, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's a step-by-step solution using BFS:

1. Start with the first box (which is already unlocked).
2. Use a queue to keep track of the boxes that can be opened with the keys we currently have.
3. Use a set to keep track of the boxes that have been opened.
4. Iterate through the keys in the currently unlocked boxes, adding any new keys to the queue and marking the corresponding boxes as opened.
5. Continue until there are no more keys to process.
6. Finally, check if the number of opened boxes is equal to the total number of boxes. If yes, return True; otherwise, return False.

Here's the implementation of the above approach:

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    if not boxes:
        return False
    
    n = len(boxes)
    opened = set()
    keys = [0]
    
    while keys:
        current_key = keys.pop()
        if current_key not in opened:
            opened.add(current_key)
            for key in boxes[current_key]:
                if key not in opened and key < n:
                    keys.append(key)
    
    return len(opened) == n
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - `opened` is a set to keep track of the boxes that have been opened.
   - `keys` is a list used as a queue to process the keys we have, starting with the key for the first box (0).

2. **Processing Keys**:
   - While there are keys in the queue:
     - Pop a key from the queue.
     - If the corresponding box hasn't been opened yet:
       - Mark it as opened.
       - Add all keys found in this box to the queue (if they haven't been used and are valid keys).

3. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all keys, check if the number of opened boxes is equal to the total number of boxes.

### Test Cases
The given test cases should be verified to ensure the function works correctly:

```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Expected output: True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Expected output: True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Expected output: False
```

This implementation ensures that we efficiently determine if all boxes can be unlocked using a straightforward BFS approach.
